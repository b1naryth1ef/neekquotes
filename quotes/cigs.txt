00:06 < neek> Fucking douche
00:06 < neek> man
00:06 < neek> walks up to me as I'm walking into 7-11
00:07 < neek> "Can I get a quarter? Just need a quarter"
00:07 < neek> "Uhh maybe after I buy my shit"
00:07 < neek> I walk into store
00:07 < neek> he walks into store
00:07 < neek> I walk to fridges to get my shit
00:07 < neek> he tells the clerk "that guy is gonna give me a quarter"
00:07 < neek> he buys cigs
00:07 < neek> and bolts
00:08 < neek> clerk doesn't even ask me for a quarter, he knows me, I buy 40s w/ change sometimes
00:09 < neek> I get to my car and sit. Go back in and drop two dimes and a nickel on the counter. "I should've just told the guy to fuck off"
00:09 < neek> fucking douchebag
00:09 < neek> clerk just tells me he'd take the change from the donation for kids w/ some disease jar
00:09 < neek> fucking douchebag
00:09 < neek> for a pack of cigs
00:10 < neek> I don't wanna be the guy that's like 'fuck that guy, he ain't gettin' my change'
00:10 < neek> this guy obviously didn't need it
00:10 < neek> gold chains and shoes and shit
00:11 < neek> so I was polite
00:11 < neek> "maybe"
00:11 < neek> and he exploits my politeness and the clerk's politeness and gets his cigs
00:11 < neek> piece of shit
