22:52 <@neek> In California: :| Pay for marriage license, ... license invalid 'til someone on this magic list signs it :|
22:52 <@neek> "judge, county clerk, priest, minister or rabbi of any religious denomination" -- RELIGIOUS DENOMINATION MUST BE "REAL"
22:53 <@neek> subgenius is not "REAL" because my church hasn't paid the right dues to the conspiracy, except TAXES.
22:55 <@neek> Pay for... a license.. from the state... that isn't valid.. 'til it's signed... by a religious official... that is a solid part... of the conspiracy...
22:55 <@neek> O.O
22:55 <@neek> Or a county clerk.
22:55 <@neek> "RUBBER STAMP"
22:56 <@neek> Blaaaah.
22:57 <@B1|Irssi> lol
22:59 <@neek> Yes, I want to stick my dick in the ear of people that labor under the delusion their... religion... is 'right'. :| I want a ceremony, I want hoopla, I want a self-righteous 'religious' bastard to BLESS my marriage!
23:00 <@neek> The signing of the marriage license by the religious man will not be hidden away, as sacred 'paperwork', that is has been at every wedding I have ever attended! No!
23:00 <@B1|Irssi> lol
23:01 <@B1|Irssi> RAR RAR RAR
23:01 <@neek> We will hold the license in front of every, PRESENT IT! Say: Here is THE DOCUMENT that makes us married. Here is THE RELIGIOUS OFFICIAL that will SIGN IT and make it NOT-EXPIRE!
23:02 <@neek> s/every/everyone/
23:02 <@neek> And that religious official will be a SUBGENIUS in his FINEST LINENS.
23:03 <@neek> A self-righteous windbag like none other! Bless this, bless that!
23:03 <@neek> Condemn this, condemn that!
23:03 <@neek> He will be the spitting image of a religious official!
23:05 <@neek> It will be tasteful, it will be elegant, it will be everything the pink conspiracy collaborators think a wedding, THEIR WEDDINGS, are... but there will be a subgenius conducting the ceremony.
23:05 <@neek> !@$%!#T^%!@$%Y$^%!@$%^&^%$
